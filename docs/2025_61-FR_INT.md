### Application of the Progressive Income Tax and Surcharge Act (Act No. 2025/61-FR)  

**Effective:** 1 January 2026  
**Audience:** Tax Officers, Regional Tax Offices  
**Classification:** Internal – Operational Guidance  

---

## 1. Purpose  

This Guidance Note explains the method of assessment, calculation, and enforcement of the progressive income tax introduced under Act No. 2025/61-FR. It is intended for use by tax officers in reviewing declarations, issuing assessments, and advising taxpayers.  

---

## 2. General Principles  

1. **Progressive Taxation**: Tax liability increases as income rises, with different brackets applying different marginal rates.  
2. **Bracket Application**: Only income above a threshold is taxed at the higher rate.  
3. **Surcharge**: Applied if the total tax (before surcharge) exceeds **5000**.  

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Assessment Method  

### Step 1 – Determine Taxable Income  
- Start with declared gross income.  
- Deduct allowable expenses (as defined under the General Tax Code).  
- Confirm residency for the fiscal year.  

### Step 2 – Apply Brackets  
- **First Bracket**: Income up to 10000 → taxed at 10%.  
- **Second Bracket**: Any income above 10000 → taxed at 20%.  

### Step 3 – Calculate Base Tax  
- Add the amounts from each bracket to determine base tax liability.  

### Step 4 – Test for Surcharge  
- If base tax > 5000, apply surcharge = 2% × base tax.  

### Step 5 – Issue Assessment  
- Record both base tax and surcharge clearly in notice.  
- Ensure taxpayer is informed of payment deadline.

## 4. Worked Examples  

### Example A – Middle Income  
Taxpayer earns **40000**.  
- First 10000 × 10% = 1000  
- Remaining 30000 × 20% = 6000  
- Base Tax = 7000  
- Since > 5000, surcharge = 2% × 7000 = 140  
- **Total Tax = 7,140**  

### Example B – Low Income  
Taxpayer earns **8000**.  
- Entire 8000 falls within first bracket: 8000 × 10% = 800  
- Base Tax = 800 (< 5000) → No surcharge  
- **Total Tax = 800**  

### Example C – High Income  
Taxpayer earns **120000**.  
- First 10000 × 10% = 1000  
- Remaining 110000 × 20% = 22000  
- Base Tax = 23000  
- Surcharge = 2% × 23000 = 460  
- **Total Tax = 23,460**

## 5. Compliance and Enforcement

- **Interest**: Apply statutory 4% annual interest on overdue balances.
