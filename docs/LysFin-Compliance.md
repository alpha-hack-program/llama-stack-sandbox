## Section 1. Contractual Penalties for Delay

### Legal Basis
In accordance with the Commercial Obligations Act of the Republic of Lysmark, and pursuant to Lysmark Finance Inc. contractual standards, any failure to perform within agreed deadlines shall incur **liquidated damages**.  

The principles are:  
1. **Daily Accrual**: A fixed monetary penalty per day of delay.  
2. **Cap Limitation**: No penalty shall exceed the maximum agreed contractual cap.  
3. **Interest Application**: Once the penalty is determined (whether capped or not), statutory or contractual interest shall accrue on that amount.  

### Internal Directive
- Penalties must be **automatically computed** according to these three principles.  
- No discretionary waiver may be granted without Legal & Compliance sign-off.  
- All calculations must be archived for audit purposes.

## Section 2. Voting Thresholds for Corporate and Organizational Decisions

### Legal Basis
Under the Corporate Governance Code of the Republic of Lysmark, Lysmark Finance Inc. and entities under its stewardship must observe minimum standards for voting legitimacy:  

1. **Turnout Requirement**: A quorum exists only if 60% or more of eligible voters participate.  
2. **Approval Requirements**:  
   - *Ordinary resolutions*: require a simple majority (>50%).  
   - *Amendments to constitutional documents*: require a special majority (≥ two-thirds).  

### Internal Directive
- No resolution shall be recognized absent compliance with turnout and threshold provisions.

## Section 3. Loan Repayment Waterfall

### Legal Basis
In line with Lysmark Financial Instruments Act §42 and company policy on structured financing, repayment of multi-tier debt shall observe strict priority rules:  

1. **Senior Creditors**: Repaid in full prior to any distribution to subordinate creditors.  
2. **Junior Creditors**: Paid subsequent to senior creditors, up to the remaining available amount.  
3. **Residual Equity**: Only after full satisfaction of senior and junior claims shall residual amounts be made available to equity holders.  

### Internal Directive
- Repayment allocations must **follow this priority order without exception**.  
- Systems must record both obligations outstanding and amounts distributed.  
- Deviation from priority constitutes a compliance breach.

## Section 4. Housing Assistance Eligibility – Public Program Interface

### Legal Basis
Pursuant to Lysmark Housing Support Regulation §19 and our operational partnership with the Ministry of Social Development, eligibility for public housing assistance shall be determined as follows:  

1. **Income Ceiling**: Household income must not exceed 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI).  
2. **Household Adjustment**: For households of more than four members, the income ceiling is raised by 10%.  
3. **Exclusivity of Benefit**: Applicants already receiving federal or regional housing subsidies are not eligible.  

### Internal Directive
- Applications must be tested against all three criteria.  
- Eligibility determination is **binary** (eligible/not eligible).  
- Supporting documentation must be attached and stored.  
- False positives constitute regulatory exposure and must be reported to Compliance.
